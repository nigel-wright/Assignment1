         <p>I am Nigel Wright, a second year Software Engineering student. I have achieved notable milestones both within and outside of the academic realm. Within my studies, I played a key role in the design and build of the winning project in the ES1050 showcase. My responsibilities included the oversight of the solid modeling which aided my teammates in the visualization of prototypes and future improvements. Beyond the classroom I have the privilege of working as an Automotive Engineering Intern. During the 16-weeks internship I was given the chance to rebuild and overhaul major vehicle components such as engines, turbos, transmissions, and axles. This internship enhance my practical skills and aided me in honing my skills in problem solving and team communication. These steps in my engineering career have enhanced my desire to learn and passion for engineering. <br> <br>My career objective is to make a significant impact in the auto industry for a major car manufacture or motorsport team. I want to leverage my prior knowledge and experience with motor vehicles to innovate and enhance the synergy of designs between the electrical hardware systems and the software. I particularly motivated by the prospect of new green car technologies and how they can be incorporated into future car designs, thus contributing to more sustainable transportation solutions. I look forward to working with like-minded professionals and organizations to bring these objectives to like and drive further innovation in the engineering field.</p>

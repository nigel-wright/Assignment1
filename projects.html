                <p>Working in a small team of engineers, I played a key role in designing critical components of a device which enabled low mobility 
                    elderly to participate in throwing games. Our team was showcase overall best judged design and best design in our catagory of throw. This project was completed over the second semester, and incorporated many fundamental tools 
                    learned in the ES1050 class. This projecet enabled a first hand perspective on the design process and allowed me to work on many 
                    team realted skills.  </p>
